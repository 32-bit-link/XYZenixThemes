Steam Library Themes | \<MULTIPLE\> | Below the discord theme tables | Various themes for the 'new' Steam library | N/A

Discord Themes:

Name | Description | Version | Status
-- | -- | -- | --
DTM-16 | A theme that brings the old UI back* | 4.X | Working (+ light theme compatible)
DTM-20 | A theme where I try to 'predict' what Discord would look like in 2020 | 2.0X | most definitely not actually working
DTM-08 | A skeuomorphic theme for Discord | 0.X | Working
Unnamed Windows 95 theme | | N/A | Unfinished
Unnamed classic terminal theme | | N/A | Planned
DTM-17 | A theme that reverts the new UI changes from early 2019 and other stuff from 2018 | N/A | Working on it I promise
Discord Sword & Shield | Theme based on Pok√©mon Sword/Shield UI i guess | 0.X | Available

\* Only as far as 2016, without making formerly always-light-mode elements light and without removing features (like search bar, video call/screenshare, and channel categories). For features added after 2016, will use the oldest version I can find as long as it does not require JS or something (like having text channels actually use a # instead of a SVG for the hashtag, which is not possible as of right now because the way Discord changed the channel list to use same classes no matter whether the channel is a voice one or a text one) There are/will be addons for DTM-16 that will revert elements to light mode and even go as far as 2015 or to remove features added after 2016, however the base DTM-16 will not remove or turn dark elements light.
