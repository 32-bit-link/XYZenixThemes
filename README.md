Discord Themes:

Name | Description | Status
-- | -- | --
DTM-16 | A theme that brings the old UI back* | Working (+ light theme compatible)
DTM-20 | A theme where I try to 'predict' what Discord would look like in 2020 | Mostly working
Discord Plus! | A skeuomorphic theme for Discord | Will fix soonâ„¢

Unnamed classic terminal theme | | Planned
DTM-18 | A theme that reverts the new UI changes from early 2019 | Abandoned
~~Unnamed Minecraft theme~~ | | Cancelled

\* Only as far as 2016, without making formerly always-light-mode elements light and without removing features (like search bar, video call/screenshare, and channel categories). For features added after 2016, will use the oldest version I can find as long as it does not require JS or something (like having text channels actually use a # instead of a SVG for the hashtag, which is not possible as of right now because the way Discord changed the channel list to use same classes no matter whether the channel is a voice one or a text one)
